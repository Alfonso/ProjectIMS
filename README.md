## What is this?
ProjectIMS stands for Project Intern Messaging System. It essentially is a chatroom that is hosted on one machine and allows others to connect to it. It incorporates usernames to distinguish users and contains some basic user commands (and a admin role). There also exists a server command line to run commands behind the scenes.
